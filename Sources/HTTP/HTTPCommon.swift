/// ```swift
///    func echo(request: HTTPRequest, response: HTTPResponseWriter ) -> HTTPBodyProcessing {
///        response.writeHeader(status: .ok)
///        return .processBody { (chunk, stop) in
///            switch chunk {
///            case .chunk(let data, let finishedProcessing):
///                response.writeBody(data) { _ in
///                    finishedProcessing()
///                }

///                response.done()
